# Archero

Archero integrates [Anbox](https://github.com/anbox/anbox) to Chromium OS for replacing Google's ARC++ (Android Runtime for Chrome), also implements window management and interactive control based on [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) protocol. It is still in an early stage of development, some functions are missing and need to be improved.

For a developer guide to play with Archero, [read it here](https://github.com/FydeOS/chromium_os-archero-developer-guide).
